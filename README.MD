The Problem We Solve:
-----
   
* There are many reasons we become “regulars”  at our favorite bars. Sometimes for the people or the atmosphere, but usually for the product. Too often we find a new craft beer that keeps us coming back for more, only to find one day that it’s been rotated out for something less savory.

* While most breweries have on-location bars or hold tours, the majority of their sales happen at third-party restaurants and bars. Most communication takes place between that bar and the brewery, leaving the customer guessing as to where the next great brews will pop up.

<br>

How Does It Work?
-----
  
* Public Users may log-in to browse the app to search for their favorite beers or discover new beers.
  
* Users can save their favorite beers to their "cooler", to keep track of where there favorite brew is on tap.

* Users can also track restaurants that currently have their favorite beers on tap.
