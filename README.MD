The Problem We Solve
-----
   
### There are many reasons we become “regulars”  at our favorite bars. Sometimes for the people or the atmosphere, but usually for the product. Too often we find a new craft beer that keeps us coming back for more, only to find one day that it’s been rotated out for something less savory.



### While most breweries have on-location bars or hold tours, the majority of their sales happen at third-party restaurants and bars. Most communication takes place between that bar and the brewery, leaving the customer guessing as to where the next great brews will pop up.
