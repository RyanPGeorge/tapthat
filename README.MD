Our Mission:

TapThat is designed to connect Brewers, Restaurants, and Beer enthusiasts through an intuitive “Tap It!” system that tracks your favorite beers and where to find them.

The Problem We Solve:
-----
   
* There are many reasons we become “regulars”  at our favorite bars. Sometimes for the people or the atmosphere, but usually for the product. Too often we find a new craft beer that keeps us coming back for more, only to find one day that it’s been rotated out for something less savory.

* While most breweries have on-location bars or hold tours, the majority of their sales happen at third-party restaurants and bars. Most communication takes place between that bar and the brewery, leaving the customer guessing as to where the next great brews will pop up.

How Does It Work?
-----
  
* To access the features of TapThat, a user is required to *log in* or *sign up* to create a free account.

* Once authorized, the user now has a private account where personal favorites may be tracked and accessed. Once redirected to your homepage, you will see some quick stats. Realtime counters track the current number of beers on tap at restaurants, the number of taps of various beers, and recent additions to the TapThat database.

* The best place to start is the *Discover* page, where the full database of beers and restaurants may be browsed through. Use the search function to quickly filter the results you're looking for!

* Once you've found a beer or restaurant that piques your interest, select it to see more details, or simply click the corresponding tracking button to track a restaurant or add a beer to your *Cooler*.

* The *Restaurant Detail* page displays a comprehensive list of all beers currently "tapped" at that location. If a beer has been rotated out and is no longer available, a user can "untap" the beer and update the list to accurately reflect the current inventory.

* The *Beer Detail* page provides a more in-depth profile of a particular beer. Users may add photo's of the beer or themselves enjoying it with friends. Select the drop-down menu to see all locations currently serving that beer, and if you've found it somewhere that isn't reflected on the app, it's time to *TapThat!*

* Select the "TAP IT!" Button to bring up a list of restaurants that are not currently carrying that beer, and select "TAP AT THIS RESTAURANT" to add it to the restaurant's list of taps. Congratulations! You've just become a contributing member of society. Now other users know where to find that beer.

* Keep your favorite drinks in arm's reach by adding them to your *Cooler* for quick access your top hops.

* Track your favorite bars and restaurants to quickly access and update spots you frequent most.
